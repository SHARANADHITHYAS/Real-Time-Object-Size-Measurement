# Real-Time-Object-Size-Measurement

# Abstract

<p>Real-time object size measurement using OpenCV involves using computer vision techniques to estimate the size of objects in a video stream or image. This can be done by first loading an image of an object, converting it to grayscale, and applying a threshold to separate the object from the background. The problem statement for a real time object size measurement project is to develop a system that can accurately and efficiently measure the dimensions of objects in real time. This can be a challenging task, as it requires the system to be able to, Identify and track the object in the image or video stream. Estimate the distance between the object and the camera. Use this information to calculate the object's dimensions. Real-time object size measurement is a challenging problem in computer vision. It is required in many applications, such as self-driving cars, robotics, and manufacturing. The goal of this project is to develop a real-time object size measurement system using computer vision.</p>

# Problem Statement

<p>
  The object detection system detects whether things are present or absent in particular scenes and from particular camera angles. The diverse object detection domains are based on varied goals and are categorized using concrete and abstract terms. The various models that are either expressly or implicitly employed for object detection.

# Objectives

<p>
  Real-time object size measurement is a challenging problem in computer vision. It is required in many applications, such as self-driving cars, robotics, and manufacturing. The goal of this project is to develop a real-time object size measurement system using computer vision. The proposed system will use a camera to capture images of objects. The images will then be processed using computer vision algorithms to identify and segment the objects. This can help identify defects or variations in size that could lead to product quality issues. Real-time object size measurement can help optimize manufacturing processes by providing immediate feedback on product dimensions. The measurements can be utilized in various applications, such as automatic parking solutions, self-driving automobiles and e-commerce platforms to determine the size of the object. This allows for adjustments and corrections to be made quickly, reducing waste and improving efficiency.
